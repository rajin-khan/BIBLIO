Relationships: (kind of redundant, this is just initial planning, refer to ERD for more accurate representation of relationships)


    - Customers * see * Books (MANY-MANY)
    
    see relationship table: - ISBN (referencing Books) *PRIMARY KEY*
                            - book_name (referencing Books)
                            - author_name (referencing Books)
                            - copies (referencing Books) *PRIMARY KEY*

    - Customers * have_borrowed * Books (MANY-MANY)

    have_borrowed table: - username (referencing Customers) *PRIMARY KEY*
                         - ISBN (referencing Books) *PRIMARY KEY*


    - Admin * supervises * Books (MANY-ONE)

    supervises table: - admin_ID (referencing Admin) *PRIMARY KEY*
                      - ISBN (referencing Books) *PRIMARY KEY*
                      - copies_added (int)
                      - copies_removed (int)

    - Admin * oversees * Requested (MANY-ONE)

    oversees table: - admin_ID (referencing Admin) *PRIMARY KEY* 
                    - req_ID (referencing Requested) *PRIMARY KEY*
                    - approved (boolean)
                    - approval_date (date)


    - Authors * write * Books (MANY-MANY)

    have table: - author_ID (referencing Authors) 
                - ISBN (referencing Books)
                
    
Integrity constraints:

1. Books will only be visible in the "sees" relationship table if the number of copies > 0 .
2. If a Customer borrows a book, the copies attribute must be decremented by 1, and its information, along with the Customer's, added to the "have_borrowed" relationship table.
3. Each Customer can borrow multiple copies of a book.
4. An Admin cannot remove a book if the number of copies = 0 .
5. The stock of a Book can never be < 0 .
6. copies_available attribute is calculated via the formula: (copies_available = stock + copies_added - copies_removed)
7. The moment certain copies are borrowed, the stock attribute is recalculated via the formula: (stock = stock - copies_borrowed)
8. If the "author_exists" attribute is False (from Requested entity table), then a new "author_ID" must be generated incrementally and added to the Authors entity table, with the name.
9. If the "author_exists" attribute is True, then a new "author_ID" need not be generated, nor the name added to the Authors entity table.
10. If the "req_ISBN" (from Requested) matches any instance of the "ISBN" attribute (from Books), then a book request cannot be generated; the request will not be added to the Requested entity table. 

Relationships will be shown in a separate ER diagram using drawio. An image of the ER diagram and its latest state will always be available on the repository.
Chen's notation shall be used, instead of Crow's foot notation.

The ER diagram will be converted to tables soon (in the Tables.txt file).
The FINAL information about the decided entities and attributes will be given there.

Additionally, a pdf with the updated concept, and images of how the website is supposed to look will be provided at all times.
